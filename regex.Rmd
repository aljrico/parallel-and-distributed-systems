# Flashback

## Work: Plant gene data set (page 80)

- What plants systems contain a Smell gene?
```{bash}
grep -l "Smell" data/Plants/*.genes
```

- How many plant systems contain a Color gene?
```{bash}
grep -l "Color" data/Plants/*.genes | wc -l
```
```{bash}
# Toni's answer
grep -l "Color" data/Plants/*.genes | cut -f1 -d "." | uniq -c
```
- What genes are in common between apple and pear? Which are specific to each of them?
```{bash}
cd data/Plants
# In common (repeated)
cat apple.genes pear.genes | cut -f2 | sort | uniq -d
echo
# True unique
cat apple.genes pear.genes | cut -f2 | sort | uniq -u
# Specific to each of them?
```
- How many genes are in common to all three plant systems?
```{bash}
# Complicated way
cd data/Plants
cut -f2 apple.genes | sort | uniq -u > apple-uniq.txt
cut -f2 pear.genes | sort | uniq -u > pear-uniq.txt
cut -f2 peach.genes | sort | uniq -u > peach-uniq.txt
cat *-uniq.txt | sort | uniq -dc | grep "3 "
rm *-uniq.txt
```
```{bash}
# Toni's answer (not totally correct)
cd data/Plants
cat *.genes | sort | uniq -c | grep "3 " | wc -l
# Column correction (still not correct)
cat *.genes | cut -f2 | sort | uniq -c | sort | grep "3 " | wc -l
```

# Regular expressions

```
egrep '^chr1.*\+' file.gff
```

## Grep when finding words
```
IN:
grep -i "chr" file.giff
OUT:
chr1 MATCH
chr2 MATCH
chromosome1 MATCH
```

```
IN:
grep -wi "chr1" file.giff
OUT:
chr1 MATCH
chr12 NO MATCH
chromosome1 NO MATCH
```

## Work
```{bash}	
cd data
# head -n2 all.gff3
cut -f3,9 all.gff3 | egrep "gene\t" | cut -f2 | cut -d ";" -f1 | grep "ID=" | sort | uniq -u | wc -l
#cut -f3,9 all.gff3 | egrep '^gene' | wc -l 
echo 
cut -f3,9 all.gff3 | egrep '^gene' | cut -f2 | cut -d ";" -f1 | grep "ID=" | sort | uniq -u | wc -l
```

## Using awk
- Check if the content is Linux. If it is yes, in the Action, just increment the count variable, which was initialised with zero in the BEGIN section.

```{bash}
cd data/articles-large
awk 'BEGIN { count=0; }
-F '\t' $4 ~ Linux { count ++; }
END { print "Number of Linux papers =", count; }' articles-large.csv
```

## Work (same in awk)

```{bash}
cd data
awk '{ if($3=="gene") print $9; }' all.gff3 | cut -f1 -d ';' | sort | uniq | wc -l
echo
awk '{ if($3=="gene") print $NF; }' all.gff3 | cut -f1 -d ';' | sort | uniq | wc -l

```
Where `$NF` means "number of fields" (columns). This works as it is the last one.
